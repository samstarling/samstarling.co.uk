  <p>I was born and grew up in the UK, where I studied Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Since then, I've worked for the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://idagio.com">IDAGIO</a>, <a href="https://kwara.com">Kwara</a> and many more.</p>
  <p>I consider myself a full-stack developer. I'm at home writing REST APIs in Ruby, Go or Scala. On the other side, you'll find me building accessible and performant React applications that sit on top of those APIs. Most of all, I'm keen on building software in an iterative fashion that makes users happy. I like using <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring technology</a>.</p>
