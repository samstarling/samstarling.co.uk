  <p>I was born and grew up in the UK, where I studied Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Since then, I've worked for <a href="#">Folder Media</a>, the <a href="#">BBC</a>, and <a href="#">SoundCloud</a>.</p>
  <p>I've been focussed mostly on back-end development, writing APIs for other teams to build their products on top of, mostly in Scala and Ruby. I'm more than comfortable with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and recently I've been trying to keep up with the latest developments in the world of front-end. I'm keen on building software that enables quick iteration, and of using <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring technology</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm a freelancer, and I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting projects. If you think you've got something I'd find interesting, <a href="mailto:hello@samstarling.co.uk">send me an e-mail</a>.</p>
