  <p><code>finagle-prometheus</code> is a Scala library that exposes metrics from your <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a> application to <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>.</p>
  <p>There are two parts to it. The first is a component which reads Finagle's internal metrics, and converts these to the equivalent classes from Prometheus' <code>simpleclient</code> library. The second is a selection of <code>Filter</code> classes that can be added to clients, to expose additional custom metrics for those clients. These are currently focussed on HTTP clients.</p>
  <p>Crucially, it also provides a handler that you can mount to an HTTP endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.</p>
  <p>The GitHub repository includes <a href="https://github.com/samstarling/finagle-prometheus/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/com/samstarling/prometheusfinagle/examples/TestServer.scala">an example</a> of how to use all of these things together.</p>
