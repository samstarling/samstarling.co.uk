This website is generally pretty neglected and under-loved â€” a lot of the content was out of date, or no longer relevant, so I'm starting again.

The next few months are going to be exciting for me: I'm leaving my job at SoundCloud at the end of November, and diving into the world of freelancing in January. I'll be staying in Berlin, so if you're interested in working together, then let's chat.

I'm taking December off. I want to use that time to learn some new skills, and to try and get back into writing, so you'll hear more from me soon.
