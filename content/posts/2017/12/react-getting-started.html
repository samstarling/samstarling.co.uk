--- title: Getting started with React created_at: 2017-12-20 00:00:00 kind: article ---

<p>I've ventured into the world of Javascript frameworks a few times now. I created a fairly large
  <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> app, and played around with
  <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>, but that was a while ago.</p>

<p>As someone who's mostly a back-end developer, observing from the sidelines, it always seemed like the JS world moved pretty
  quickly. However, now it seems like people are fairly settled on React &mdash; so it felt like a good time to learn.</p>

<p>There's a lot of material out there, some of which I've found more useful than others, and so I thought it'd be useful to
  list the bits that have helped me the most:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mb2">
    <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/">&ldquo;The Road to Learn React&rdquo;</a>, an open-source book by Robin Wieruch. Walks you through building an entire
    application, with each step building on the last. It also has a lot of good references to other resources, such as learning
    parts of ES6.</li>
  <li class="mb2">
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">&ldquo;Thinking in React&rdquo;</a> from the official documentation. This was a good way to start to understand the philosophy
    of React: including the concepts of one-way data flow, and how to think about props vs. state.</li>
  <li class="mb2">
    <a href="https://github.com/tomstuart/react-workshop">&ldquo;What Even Is A React (And So Can You!)&rdquo;</a>, a set of exercises by Tom Stuart. I'm a big fan of the koans
    style, and reimplementing parts of React and React DOM has been a useful exercise in understanding what happens behind
    the scenes.
