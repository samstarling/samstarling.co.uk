Some news: [James](https://jamesmaskell.co.uk) and I have returned to London. Berlin was great, but the time was right to come back. Freelancing since the start of 2018 has been a valuable experience, but now I'm looking forward to focussing on one thing (and not having to do accounts every month).

At the end of this month, I'll be off to work for [Monzo](https://monzo.com) as a backend engineer, working on the team that's building business accounts. ðŸ’¸
